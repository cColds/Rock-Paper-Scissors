        <p class="info">Rock, Paper Scissors, also known as Roshambo or
            Rochambeau is a classic two-person game. Players start each round by saying, “rock, paper, scissors, shoot!”
            On “shoot,” each player holds out their fist for rock, flat hand for paper, or their index and middle finger
            for scissors. Rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. See who wins each round!
